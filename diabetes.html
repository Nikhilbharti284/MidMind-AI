            <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
            <p>Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin, which acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy.</p>
            
            <p>If you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn't enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, this can cause serious health problems such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Key Fact:</strong> According to the World Health Organization, about 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, and 1.5 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year.

            <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
                    <p>Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction that stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of people with diabetes have Type 1. Symptoms often develop quickly and it's usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults.</p>
                    <p>People with Type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, there's no known way to prevent or cure Type 1 diabetes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
                    <p>With Type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't use insulin properly and can't keep your blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have Type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults.</p>
                    <p>Type 2 can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
                    <p>Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems.</p>
                    <p>Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born. However, it increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Prediabetes</h3>
                    <p>In prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough yet to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.</p>
                    <p>The good news is that if you have prediabetes, the CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program can help you make lifestyle changes to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.</p>

            <p>The symptoms of diabetes can vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not experience symptoms initially. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.</p>
